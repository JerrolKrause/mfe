                    Not all applicants will qualify for larger loan amounts or
                    most favorable loan terms. Larger loan amounts require a
                    first lien on a motor vehicle no more than ten years old,
                    that meets our value requirements, titled in your name with
                    valid insurance. Loan approval and actual loan terms depend
                    on your state of residence and your ability to meet our
                    credit standards (including a responsible credit history,
                    sufficient income after monthly expenses, and availability
                    of collateral). APRs are generally higher on loans not
                    secured by a vehicle. Highly-qualified applicants may be
                    offered higher loan amounts and/or lower APRs than those
                    shown above. Active duty military, their spouse or
                    dependents covered by the Military Lending Act may not
                    pledge any vehicle as collateral.

                  <p>
                    Example Loan: A $6,000 loan with a 24.99% APR repayable in
                    60 monthly installments would have monthly payments of
                    $176.07. This example is based on an average customer with
                    good credit.
